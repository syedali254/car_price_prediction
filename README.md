# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

This machine learning project predicts the price of a car based on various features like brand, fuel type, transmission, and more using the **Random Forest Regressor** algorithm.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

With the rise of online car sales, estimating a fair price for a car has become a crucial task. This project uses supervised machine learning to predict car prices accurately using a real-world dataset.

## ðŸ’¡ Features Used

- Car brand
- Fuel type
- Seller type
- Transmission
- Number of previous owners
- Kilometers driven
- Engine capacity
- Car age

## ðŸ§  Model Used

- **Random Forest Regressor** â€” A powerful ensemble learning method based on decision trees that provides high accuracy and handles non-linear data well.

##  I have made it using Streamlit so make sure you run it as streamlit run car_app.py
